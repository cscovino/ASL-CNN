# ASL-CNN

A translator for american sign language built with convolutional neural networks (CNN).
For this project I only took four letters of the alphabet: A, B, C and D. So, the model was trained only for this signs and could predict only these letters.

## Getting started

To run and test the app first you need a copy of the project. For this you have to run this command in the command-line

```
 git clone https://github.com/cscovino/ASL-CNN.git
```

This assumes that you have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Prerequisites

It is needed to have installed [Python 3.5.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

Once you have cloned the repository you need to install some libraries of python (if you don't have them).

```
 pip install numpy
 pip install opencv-python
 pip install --upgrade tensorflow
 pip install tflearn
 pip install matplotlib.pyplot
 pip install tqdm
```

## Built with
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - An interpreted high-level programming language.
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - An open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An open source software library for high performance numerical computation.
* [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/) - A modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow.
